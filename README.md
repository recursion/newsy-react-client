## Newsy

A simple web client for searching the newsapi.org api build using react/redux. Newsy makes using the variety of newsapi.org search options easy and accessible.

Newsy currently proxy's requests through a private express.js server so no additional api key is needed. Advanced features may be added to the server in the future, but for now, it simply attaches an api key and passes query's through to newsapi.org, returning the results to the client. 

Easily convertible to something that stores and uses your own api key from the client, and calls direct to the newsapi.org api - this may be added as a base option in the future.

Started from the wonderful react-redux boilerplate: https://github.com/flexdinesh/react-redux-boilerplate.git

## Features
Allows users to easily search a plethora of news sites using a simple keyword search or a variety of advanced options.

- Mobile First, Responsive design.
- Advanced and/or Simple search options.

### Implemented API:
- [x] Search 'Top Headlines'
  - [x] Query Strings (or empty query's)
  - [x] Sources or Country and Category.
  - [ ] pageSize -- currently we only ever use the default of 20

- Search 'Everything'
  - [x] Query Strings (no empty queries)
  - [x] Sources or Country and Category.
  - [x] Language
  - [x] SortBy
  - [x] From Date
  - [x] To Date
  - [ ] Domains
  - [ ] exclude domains
  - [ ] pageSize -- currently we only ever use the default of 20

## TODO
- Lots of testing that could/should be done here. Since it was a prototype, only a few tests were written during development. The queryBuilder in particular would be a good target for testing, as well as all components dependant on certain variables for thier display.
- A possible design choice that could be made is to have a 'top-headlines' and a 'everything' page. So that for searching those targets, there is a link to click on instead of a radio button. This would allow for displaying only the options available to those targets, instead of having to use logic to decide which options to show.
- There are a few remaining api features that could be added.
- Styling/UI/UX improvements. Currently this is super simple and has room for improvements such as a [sliding panel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-sliding-pane) for advanced options.
- When the image failes to load or can't be found, attempt to load a logo image for the source instead of just a white filler.
